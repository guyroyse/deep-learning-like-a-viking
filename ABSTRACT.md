# Deep Learning like a Viking
## Building Convolutional Neural Networks with Keras

The Vikings came from the land of ice and snow, from the midnight sun, where
the hot springs flow. In addition to longships and bad attitudes, they had a
system of writing that we, in modern times, have dubbed the Younger Futhark (or
ᚠᚢᚦᚬᚱᚴ if you're a Viking). These sigils are more commonly called runes and
have been mimicked in fantasy literature and role-playing games for decades.

Of course, having an alphabet, runic or otherwise, solves lots of problems.
But, it also introduces others. The vikings had the same problem we do today.
How were they to get their automated software systems to recognize the
hand-carved input of a typical boatman? Of course, they were never able to
solve this problem and were instead forced into a life of burning and
pillaging. Today, we have deep learning and neural networks and can,
fortunately, avoid such a fate.

In this session, we are going to build a Convolution Neural Network to
recognize hand-written runes from the Younger Futhark. We'll be using Keras to
write easy to understand Python code that creates and trains the neural network
to do this. We'll wire this up to a web application using Flask and some
client-side JavaScript so you can write some runes yourself and see if it
recognizes them.

When we're done, you'll understand how Convolution Neural Networks work, how to
build your own using Python and Keras, and how to make it a part of an
application using Flask. Maybe you'll even try seeing what it thinks of the
Bluetooth logo?
